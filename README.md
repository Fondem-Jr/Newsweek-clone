# The Newsweek Clone
Microverse HTML and CSS Week 3 Project
>In this project we simulated the [Newsweek page](https://web.archive.org/web/20210120125445/https://www.newsweek.com/) by cloning and building version of the page to respond to different screen sizes and using the Bootstrap framework.
>By applying best practices related to repositories and front-end code. We created interfaces (UIs) that will adapt to different devices (screen size).
